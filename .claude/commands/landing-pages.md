# Landing Page Generator

You are a landing page orchestrator that gathers requirements, generates 3 unique design directions using the `example-skills:frontend-design` skill, then launches 3 parallel subagents to build the HTML based on those design directions.

## Input

Landing page request: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather essential information in a SINGLE call with these questions:

1. **Primary Goal**: What is the main objective of this landing page?
   - Lead generation (email signup, contact form)
   - Product sales (direct purchase, pricing)
   - App download / SaaS signup
   - Event registration
   - Information / awareness

2. **Target Audience**: Who is the primary audience?
   - Demographics (age, profession, interests)
   - Pain points they're experiencing
   - What motivates them to take action

3. **Key Content Elements**: What must be included?
   - Headline / value proposition
   - Key features or benefits (list 3-5)
   - Call-to-action text (e.g., "Get Started", "Sign Up Free")
   - Specific sections needed (testimonials, FAQ, pricing, etc.)

4. **Brand Requirements** (optional): Any specific constraints?
   - Brand colors (provide hex codes if available)
   - Logo or images to include (provide URLs or descriptions)
   - Any styles to avoid

Wait for the user's response before proceeding. If $ARGUMENTS already provides sufficient detail for some questions, skip those and only ask what's missing.

## Phase 2: Content Brief Synthesis

After receiving user input, synthesize a **content-only brief** that captures:

- **Project Summary**: One paragraph combining the user's request with gathered requirements
- **Content Specifications**: Headlines, features, CTAs, sections needed
- **Brand Constraints**: Only include if the user specified brand colors, logos, or styles to avoid
- **Technical Requirements**: Self-contained HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript, fully responsive, CDN only for fonts/icons

**CRITICAL**: This brief contains NO design direction whatsoever - only content and functional requirements.

## Phase 3: Generate Design Directions with Frontend-Design Skill

Now invoke the `example-skills:frontend-design` skill THREE times to generate 3 completely unique design directions. Each invocation should ask the skill to create a distinct creative direction for a landing page.

**IMPORTANT**: You must invoke the Skill tool 3 separate times, each time asking it to generate a DIFFERENT design approach. Ask the skill something like:

**For Variant 1:**
"Generate a unique, bold design direction for a landing page. Include: color palette (with hex codes), typography choices, layout approach, visual style, spacing philosophy, and any distinctive design elements. Make this design direction #1 of 3 - be creative and distinctive."

**For Variant 2:**
"Generate a completely different design direction for a landing page - distinct from variant 1. Include: color palette (with hex codes), typography choices, layout approach, visual style, spacing philosophy, and any distinctive design elements. Make this design direction #2 of 3 - explore a different aesthetic entirely."

**For Variant 3:**
"Generate a third unique design direction for a landing page - distinct from variants 1 and 2. Include: color palette (with hex codes), typography choices, layout approach, visual style, spacing philosophy, and any distinctive design elements. Make this design direction #3 of 3 - push creative boundaries."

Capture the full design direction output from each skill invocation. These will be passed to the subagents.

## Phase 4: Parallel Landing Page Generation

First, create the output directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages
```

Then launch 3 parallel Task tool calls. Each subagent receives:
1. The content brief (same for all)
2. The unique design direction generated by the frontend-design skill (different for each)

**IMPORTANT**: Launch all 3 tasks in a SINGLE message to run them in parallel.

### Subagent 1

Use Task tool with these parameters:
- description: "Create landing page variant 1"
- subagent_type: "landing-page-designer"
- prompt:

```
Create landing page variant 1 of 3.

## Content Brief
[INSERT THE CONTENT BRIEF HERE]

## Design Direction
[INSERT THE DESIGN DIRECTION FROM FRONTEND-DESIGN SKILL INVOCATION #1 HERE]

## Technical Requirements
- Self-contained HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- No external dependencies except CDN for fonts/icons
- Proper semantic HTML and accessibility (alt texts, ARIA labels)

## Output
Save the final HTML to /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-1.html
```

### Subagent 2

Use Task tool with these parameters:
- description: "Create landing page variant 2"
- subagent_type: "landing-page-designer"
- prompt:

```
Create landing page variant 2 of 3.

## Content Brief
[INSERT THE CONTENT BRIEF HERE]

## Design Direction
[INSERT THE DESIGN DIRECTION FROM FRONTEND-DESIGN SKILL INVOCATION #2 HERE]

## Technical Requirements
- Self-contained HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- No external dependencies except CDN for fonts/icons
- Proper semantic HTML and accessibility (alt texts, ARIA labels)

## Output
Save the final HTML to /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-2.html
```

### Subagent 3

Use Task tool with these parameters:
- description: "Create landing page variant 3"
- subagent_type: "landing-page-designer"
- prompt:

```
Create landing page variant 3 of 3.

## Content Brief
[INSERT THE CONTENT BRIEF HERE]

## Design Direction
[INSERT THE DESIGN DIRECTION FROM FRONTEND-DESIGN SKILL INVOCATION #3 HERE]

## Technical Requirements
- Self-contained HTML with inline CSS and JavaScript
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- No external dependencies except CDN for fonts/icons
- Proper semantic HTML and accessibility (alt texts, ARIA labels)

## Output
Save the final HTML to /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-3.html
```

## Phase 5: Verification, Server Launch, and Presentation

After all 3 subagents complete, verify the outputs:

```bash
ls -la /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/
```

Then **automatically start the local preview server** in the background:

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting the server, check if port 8080 is already in use and kill any existing process:

```bash
lsof -ti :8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
```

Then start the server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory /Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/
```

**IMPORTANT**: Run this server command using the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true` so it doesn't block. This allows the user to immediately preview the pages.

Present results to the user:

## Landing Page Variations Generated

I've created 3 landing page variations based on your requirements. Each variant has a unique design approach generated by the frontend-design skill:

| Variant | Design Theme | File Path |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Brief description of design direction 1] | `/Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-1.html` |
| 2 | [Brief description of design direction 2] | `/Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-2.html` |
| 3 | [Brief description of design direction 3] | `/Users/elvissaravia/CC-CH1/tmp/landing-pages/variant-3.html` |

### Preview Server Running

The local server is now running. View the landing pages at:
- http://localhost:8080/variant-1.html
- http://localhost:8080/variant-2.html
- http://localhost:8080/variant-3.html

To stop the server later, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or kill the process.

Then ask if the user wants to:
- Refine any specific variant
- Combine elements from multiple variants
- Export or move files to a different location
- Generate additional variations

## Important Guidelines

- **Design comes from the skill**: The `frontend-design` skill generates ALL design decisions. Do not invent or modify design directions.
- **Subagents execute only**: The landing-page-designer subagents implement the design direction they receive - they do not make creative decisions.
- **Self-Contained Output**: Each HTML file must work independently without external files
- **Responsive Design**: All variants must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Include proper semantic HTML, alt texts, ARIA labels where needed
- **Performance**: Optimize inline assets, use efficient CSS
- **No Build Steps**: Output should work by simply opening the HTML file
- **CDN Only**: If external libraries are needed (fonts, icons), use CDN links only
